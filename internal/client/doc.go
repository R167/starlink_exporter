// Package client provides a gRPC client for communicating with Starlink dishes.
//
// The client package abstracts the Starlink gRPC API, providing methods to fetch
// status and history data from the dish. It uses native protobuf-generated code
// to communicate with the SpaceX.API.Device.Device/Handle service.
